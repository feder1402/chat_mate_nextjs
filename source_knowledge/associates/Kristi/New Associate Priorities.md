To be successful as a new associate, follow these steps:

1. **Attend Local Events**: Attend monthly and weekly events in your local area to connect with successful associates in your area. Invite guests so they can learn more about LegalShield's products and the business opportunity. You can find local events by visiting the Events section of your Prospect by PPLSI mobile app or [LegalShield Calendar](https://legalshieldcalendar.com).

2. **Get Fast Start Qualified**: Aim to attend a Fast Start training and become fast start qualified within your first 20 days. This training will help you understand how to market the products, effectively prospect, and take advantage of special bonus opportunities available to new associates. Find a Fast Start training on [LegalShield Calendar](https://legalshieldcalendar.com) by searching "Fast Start".

3. **Utilize Resources**: Access the information available in your back office by visiting [LS Engage](https://LSEngage.com). Find resources, track your qualifications, view commissions, and use available tools to help you build a successful business.

4. **Use Three-Way Calls**: Leverage three-way calls to get expert help in answering questions from prospects while you learn. Three-way calls can be made with your upline sponsor or another mentor in the business. Learn more about three-way calls by attending a Fast Start training. 

5. **Commit to Daily Exposures**: Make it a goal to have at least two exposures every day sharing resources that highlight products and the business opportunity using the Prospect by PPLSI App. Exposures occur when you share a resource with a prospect, while engagements occur when a prospect clicks on a resource you share. Track your daily exposures and engagements in your Prospect app.

6. **Stay Engaged**: Stay connected through team training, social media groups, and monthly communications. Available social media groups include the [Associate Support Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pplsiassociatesupport) and the [Associate Success Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/pplsiassociatesuccess).
