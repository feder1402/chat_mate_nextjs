# Linear, Leveraged, Residual – How Do the 3 Main Types of Income Apply to You?
What if you could earn income based on providing access to important services to people who need them? But wait – before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s talk about the different types of income. 

We all need to make money to survive and thrive. But did you know that there are different ways to make that money? There are three main income streams: linear, leveraged (or passive), and residual. 

## Linear income 
Maybe you wake up to an alarm clock every morning, grab a cup of coffee, and head out the door to your daily job. You are most likely earning linear income. You receive a paycheck based on how much work you do. If you put in more hours, hopefully you get paid a bit more money. At the end of the day, you come home with money that you directly earned by working a job. 

## Leveraged or passive income 
Let’s say you start building a business by selling services to other people. After a while, you begin adding people to your business team. These people begin selling the same services, and you earn override commissions when your team members make sales. Leveraged income is what you earn when you rely on your business associates to make money for your business. 

## Residual income 
Picture this: You work hard, putting lots of hours and effort toward a cause that you are passionate about. Your hard labor starts paying off and you continue to earn money on the work you have already done. The income you receive after an initial investment of time and resources is called residual income.
