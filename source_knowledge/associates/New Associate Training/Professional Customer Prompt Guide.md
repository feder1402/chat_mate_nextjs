### Professional Customer Prompt Guide

**General Approach:**
1. Find out a bit about the prospect and share your 30-second story.
2. Let them know you have a video that explains all the details.
3. Ask the best way to send the video (text, DM, or email).
4. Set a call-back time and remember to follow up. Ask, "What did you like best about what you saw," agree with whatever positive thing they say, and then do a three-way call to close.

### Approach #1

**Initial Contact Script (email, text, or call):**
- **Message:**
  - "Hi (insert their first name). I know we don’t know each other but I'm always looking to work with other sharp people. I'm looking to expand my business and curious if you are keeping your business options open if it won’t interfere with your primary business (or job). If not, no problem at all. Nice meeting you either way."
  - "We help connect families and business owners with affordable legal access. I’m multitasking right now so can’t get into it much, but can we set aside some time to speak with each other this evening or tomorrow to discuss the details? I’m free around 5 pm Pacific tonight or 11 am Pacific tomorrow. Would either time work for you?"
  - "Ok perfect. Give me a call at xxx-xxx-xxxx. What’s yours so I’ll know it’s you calling me?"

**Text Before Meeting:**
- "Hey (insert their first name), it’s (insert your first name). Looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow at 11 am. In the meantime, here is a short commercial to give you an idea of what we do."
- (Send a 1-3 minute video from the prospect app)

### Approach #2

**Initial Contact Script (email, text, or call):**
- **Message:**
  - "Hi (insert their name). I know we don’t know each other but I'm always looking to work with other sharp people. I'm looking to expand my business and curious if you are keeping your business options open, if it won’t interfere with your primary business (or job). If not, no problem at all. Nice meeting you either way."
  - "We help connect families and business owners with affordable legal access. I’m multitasking right now so can’t get into it much but we work from home doing mainly appointment setting and leadership development. I work with most people simply in their spare time outside of their other commitments. I have a video that explains the details better than I can through text. Can I get that over to you?"
  - "Sure thing, I’ll send it over to you shortly. Is text preferred or would email be best?"
  - (Send full presentation video from the prospect app)

**Follow Up:**
1. "What was your favorite part?"
2. "That’s my favorite part as well. I’d love to discuss this with you further. Let’s hop on a quick call xxx-xxx-xxxx? What number are you calling from, so I’ll know it’s you calling me?"

### Warm Market Scripts (email, text, or call)

**Script 1:**
- "Hi (Insert their name). Hope you’ve been well. I recently started my own company and I’m looking to work with other sharp people. I’m curious if you are keeping your income options open if it won’t interfere with your primary job. If not, no problem at all. Nice reconnecting with you either way."

**Alternate Script:**
- "Hi (insert their name). Thanks for checking out my stories today. The kids had a blast. Having nothing to do with that, I recently started my own company and I’m looking to work with other sharp people. I’m curious if you are keeping your income options open if it won’t interfere with your primary job. If not, no problem at all. Nice reconnecting either way."
