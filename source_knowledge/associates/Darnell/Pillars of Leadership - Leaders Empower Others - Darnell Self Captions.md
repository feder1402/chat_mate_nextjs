# Pillars of Leadership - Leaders Empower Others - Darnell Self

Tonight, I have the opportunity to share a little about leading and empowering others. This event is about becoming better leaders, which makes everything around us better.

I've learned through years of mistakes and leading a diverse group. I'm not perfect and don't strive for perfection but for excellence. I'm going to share how to build an organization of independent leaders.

In our industry, you guide your team to people who can lead them. You can be a two and have tens on your team who go executive, and because they go executive, you go platinum.

Leaders become great not because of their power but their ability to empower others. Your job is to guide your team, not necessarily lead them directly.

Influence is the capacity to direct the behaviors of others. Effective communication and celebrating wins are crucial. Listening is more important than talking.

Celebrate small wins and help people course-correct. This builds trust and empowers them. Lower assignments if necessary to help them do more.

Accept failures as lessons towards success. Every failure is a signpost towards your goals. Help your team understand this mindset.

Remind your team of their why. This keeps them motivated and moving forward. Regularly revisit and understand their why.

An independent leader invites people to events without you. They can lead their teams independently. Spend time with the right people and help them grow.

Empower others to become independent leaders. Your growth comes from helping others grow. No more self-doubt; you are the right person to lead. Take your business to the next level. See you at the top. God bless.
