### Regional Vice Presidents

LegalShield has selected some of the most successful associates in your area to help support all associates. These leaders are your Regional Vice Presidents. These RVPs help create local meetings, trainings, Zoom presentations, and support all associates regardless of what organization you are in. They work with additional associates in local markets referred to as “Regional Sales & Training Council, Regional Managers, and Certified Meeting Coordinators” who help create local events to support all associates. If you have questions about what is happening in your state or province, information on Super Saturdays, or want to know how you can get more involved with local associates, we encourage you to reach out to these leaders.
