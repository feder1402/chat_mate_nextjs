### Best Practices for Saving Members

**Pre-Cancel Status:**
- Members enter pre-cancel status when a payment fails, giving a 45-day window to update payment info before cancellation.

**Communication Tips:**
1. **Informing Members:**
   - Explain that pre-cancel is often due to outdated payment methods.
   - Assist members in updating payment info via Login.LegalShield.com or through a three-way call to the Rapid Response Line (866.966.2222).

2. **Financial Hardship:**
   - Show empathy and highlight how LegalShield can assist with debt collectors, job loss, or changing the draft date.

3. **Non-Use Concerns:**
   - Remind members of accrued attorney hours, benefits of the mobile app, and services like Will preparation and 24/7 emergency access.

4. **Bad Experience:**
   - Listen and understand the issue, file an Attorney Service Concern if necessary, and apologize while ensuring the member knows their feedback will be investigated.

**Final Steps:**
- Review membership features and value.
- Share resources available on [LSEngage](https://LSEngage.com) and the Prospect by PPLSI mobile app if needed. 

**Important Contacts:**
- Member Services Rapid Response Line: 866.966.2222
- General Membership Support: 800.654.7757
