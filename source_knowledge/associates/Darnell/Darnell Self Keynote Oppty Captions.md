What's going to help you out as I go through this talk is to realize that everything happens for you, not to you. Repeat after me: "Everything happens for me, not to me."
My first network marketing company cost $5,000 to get started. That actually happened for me. When I got to LegalShield, it was $249. I was used to asking for $5,000, so asking for $249 was much easier.

At LegalShield, I would say, "Guess what? The best part is, it's only $249. You have an opportunity to change the rest of your life for $250. Is that crazy?" My posture and delivery were different because of my previous experience.
The first training I went to in this industry was $300. It was called a basic training. Here, my first fast start training was maybe $10 or $20. I said, "Guess what? People who have succeeded will actually teach you and coach you for like $20." That happened for me too.
The Super Saturday event in that training was $600. Here, it's maybe $30. That was happening for me. I didn't make any money there, but God was preparing me for this company. I had a head start.

I had success my first year because I came from somewhere. It all happened for me, not to me. Someone in this room is not happy about their current situation, but it's happening for you. Look at your current situation and gain the lessons from it.
Every single speaker mentioned belief. Belief is the Difference Maker. Unfortunately, some of the things we've been believing have held us back. Let's talk about why we believe what we believe and how to change it.
We believe things for various reasons: because our mom told us, because a teacher said it, personal experience, or faith. None of these are wrong or right, but they shape our belief system.

The very thing we say we want, success, is in contradiction to what we want to avoid, rejection. You need rejection to get the success. Embrace it.
Visualize what you want. Think big enough that affirmations get you excited. Be around people who compliment and encourage you. Your associations will make or break you.
Take full responsibility for where you are. You can't be a repeat champion doing what you used to do. Visualize what you want. Get around people who empower you.

Leaders become great not because of their power but their ability to empower others. Your success comes from helping others tap into their potential.

It's time for you to win. Take full responsibility for your success. Visualize what you want and surround yourself with the right people. Empower others and you will grow. No more self-doubt. See you at the top. God bless.
