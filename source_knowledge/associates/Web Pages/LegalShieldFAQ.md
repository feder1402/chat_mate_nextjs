##  What is LegalShield?

 For over 50 years, LegalShield has made it affordable and easy for its members to connect with its network of vetted, dedicated law firms across the United States and parts of Canada that average 22 years of experience. (LegalShield provides access to legal services offered by a network of provider law firms to its members through membership-based participation.) 

##  What is a legal subscription service (or pre-paid legal plan), and how does it work?

 Instead of paying a lawyer by the hour, you pay a small membership fee with LegalShield and have access to a dedicated provider law firm in your state for the legal services membership you select but without a huge bill. Prices and coverage vary depending on the membership services you select. 

##  Is LegalShield the same as Pre-Paid Legal Services, Inc.?

While we have a variety of sales channels, we believe in helping our independent associates find empowerment as business owners.

Today, we continue to harness the power of technology to empower over 4.5 million individuals and 140,000 businesses across the United States and parts of Canada to take their future into their own hands through our tools, services, and partnerships.
