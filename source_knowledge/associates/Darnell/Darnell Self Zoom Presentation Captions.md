# Darnell Self Zoom Presentation: What to do in your first 48 hours as an associate

Greetings and welcome to the PPLSI family. My name is Darnell Self. I've been working out of my home in Maryland for over 20 years because of this amazing company.

It's your first 48 hours, but guess what? I had my first 48 hours as well. If I had to do it all again, I would do it just like this. Find out where a local event is in your area so you can attend. Being in the right rooms is important.

Get around the most successful associates. Our company has a hybrid model, so some events will be in person and some via Zoom. Attend these events to learn from the best.

We want to get you paid and promoted. We call it fast start qualified. The company gives you 20 days to become fast start qualified and earn your bonuses. Many people wait until the last two days, but why not do it in your first two days?

To get fast start qualified, you need three customers and one business partner. One of those customers might become an associate. This increases your belief level because you've already hit your first rank and gotten paid.

Gain access to as much information as fast as you can. There are several videos that will show you how to launch your business, structure it, and answer questions.

Use three-way calls to get expert help in answering questions. This way, you learn while your prospect gets the answers they need.

Today, you have access to many resources right in your back office. Gain that information and education to become more competent and confident.
