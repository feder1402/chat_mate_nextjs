# LegalShield Story
In 1969, an Oklahoma insurance salesman named Harland Stonecipher was in a car accident. Even 
though he was not at fault, Harland had trouble paying the expensive legal fees from the 
accident. He did not want others to be caught in the same financial predicament. Three years 
later, Harland became the founder, chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Pre-Paid Legal 
Services, Inc.

Harland pioneered the idea of a proprietary network of law firms that makes legal 
representation accessible and affordable. For 40 years, Harland led his company from a one-room
 operation to being listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999. Today, this vision of 
 affordable quality legal services is known as LegalShield. Although Harland passed away in 
 November of 2014, LegalShield is stronger than ever, serving 4.5 million individuals and 
 140,000 business across North America.
