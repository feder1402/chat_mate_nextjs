# Welcome to PPLSI - With Darnell Self

Congratulations and welcome to the PPLSI family. My name is Darnell Self. I'm one of the many million-dollar income earners here. Again, congratulations on your decision to join us.

I had a day one just like you. I used to work at the mall, 60-80 hours a week, missing out on personal life. A friend introduced me to PPLSI. The system in place impressed me, and people shared their best practices and mistakes with me.

## What to do in your first 48 Hours

### Making a List
Make a list of 10 people you love and who love you. We'll give you a short script to send to them and a video for them to watch. You don't have to think about what to say; we've got you covered.

### Fast Start Training
We'll give you a link to sign up for our fast start training class, taught by successful associates. This training will help you take your business to the next level.

### Game Plan Interview
Get with your sponsor to set up a game plan interview. This will help you determine how much time you have to earn your desired amount of money. We'll design a plan specifically for you.

## Conclusion
Congratulations again and welcome to the PPLSI family. I cannot wait to hear your story. The best is yet to come.
