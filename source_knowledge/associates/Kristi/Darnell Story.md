What is Darnell Story?
=======================
Darnell & Traci Self spent several years of their lives in the retail arena, sometimes working more than 60 hours a week. If limited time wasnâ€™t challenging enough, their funds were limited too. Tired of living check-to-check, at the age of 25, Darnell decided to test the entrepreneurial waters. He admits, it was hard to leave his comfort zone; however, it would have been even harder for him to leave his dreams behind!

For almost four years, he tried several different opportunities with very little success. What appeared to be a lengthy struggle turned out to be an invaluable season of preparation.

When they started LegalShield their kids were 8 and 2-years old. Darnell thanks God for delaying their dreams so he could become humble enough to handle all the blessings that were already on their way. Now that their children are in their 20s and 30s, Darnell and Traci look back on all the wonderful family times and memories they have because they could be stay-at-home parents. 

They have to pinch themselves when they think about their 25+ year journey with LegalShield. They pray that their example becomes the bridge that gives hope to others to start their own walk toward their DESTINY!
