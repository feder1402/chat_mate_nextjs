This document offers some recommendations for experienced associates so they continue growing.

To continue growing as an experienced associate, consider the following strategies:

1. **Attend Weekly Events**: Regularly invite guests and take part in local and virtual weekly events to expand your network and learn from others. Invite guests so they can learn more about LegalShield's products and the business opportunity. You can find weekly events by visiting the Events section of your Prospect by PPLSI mobile app or on [LegalShield Calendar](legalshieldcalendar.com).
 
2. **Commit to 2 Exposures Every Day**: Make it a goal to have at least two exposures every day sharing resources that highlight products and the business opportunity using the Prospect by PPLSI App. Exposures occur when you share a resource with a prospect, while engagements occur when a prospect clicks on a resource you share. Track your daily exposures and engagements in your Prospect app.

3. **Help New Associates**: Mentor new associates by helping them attend a Fast Start training in their first 20 days. Fast Start training schedules are located on [LegalShield Calendar](legalshieldcalendar.com) by searching "Fast Start". 

4. **Attend the International Convention**: Learn from top leaders and keynote speakers, experience the highest levels of recognition in the company, and attend breakout training sessions to gain new insights and business success strategies. Register at [LegalShield International Convention](https://shieldassociate.com/convention). 

5. **Retain Your Members**: Focus on selling memberships effectively, encourage members to utilize their membership and download their mobile apps. For more information and tips on how to improve your retention visit LSEngage.com > Training > Membership Retention. 

6. **Stay Engaged**: Stay connected through team training, social media groups, and monthly communications. Available social media groups include the Associate Support Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/pplsiassociatesupport and the Associate Success Facebook Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/pplsiassociatesuccess/. Tune into the Monthly Communication Show on the 1st day of every month at 10:00a.m. CT on legalshieldassociate.com/show.

7. **Be Here a Year from Now**: Commit to the core commitments and continuously seek personal development opportunities.

By implementing these strategies, you can enhance your skills, expand your network, and achieve greater success in your business.
