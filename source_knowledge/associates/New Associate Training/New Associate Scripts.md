### Getting Started Right

**Make a list of your 10 closest contacts:**
- This list includes the people who always help you out (e.g., your mom, sister, best friend).
- These individuals form your "hot list" of contacts.

**Membership/Opportunity Focused:**
- **Message to send to your top 10 prospects (those who are very familiar with you):**
  - "Hey ________, I am starting a new business, and there’s something I want to show you. I figure you may or may not be interested, but it will only take a few minutes. If I send you a 3-minute video, will you watch it for me? Text me back when you watch it."

- **Message to send to other people on your list, along with the link to the resource (PPLSIProtect.com):**
  - "________, you may or may not be interested, but there’s something I want to show you. It will only take a few minutes. If I send you a 3-minute video, will you watch it?"

**Dealing with Objections:**
- **I wouldn’t be interested (not for me):**
  - "That’s fine, like I said you may not be interested, but it’s only 3 minutes and if you see what I’m doing, even if you’re not interested, you might be able to refer some people to me. Would you please take 3 minutes to look at it?”

- **What is it? Can you just tell me about it?:**
  - "I’d love to tell you about it, because I’m really excited. But, I’m just getting started and that 3-minute video will do a much better job than I can right now. Just text me when you watch it, and we can talk."

- **I don’t have time:**
  - "I know you’re super busy, which is why I sent you the 3-minute video instead of the more detailed 20-minute version. Can you take 3 minutes for me? Like I said, you may or may not be interested, but I wanted to share it with you."
